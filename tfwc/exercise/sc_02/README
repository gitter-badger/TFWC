The files in "$NS_HOME/exercise/sc" are to check TCP/TFRC/TFWC
performance verification (sanity check). We want to understand the
TFWC's dynamics, and also would like to review TCP/TFRC dynamics in
odrder to understand the system. By doing so, we expect to find bugs in
TFRC.

The primary purpose is to understand TFWC systems.
